# BRACKETS BACKUP

This extension will create a backup copy (.bak) of the active file 
in its current directory.

* +You can access the functions by going to the menu bar and doing the following:
* MANUAL BACKUP                 = [Backup] menu -> [Backup - CREATE]
* AUTO BACKUP (Default 3 mins.) = [Backup] menu -> [Backup - START Auto]
* SET TIME                      = [Backup] menu -> SET Auto Backup TIME

* Why do I need this extension and why did I create it?
At first, I never thought that my program based text files won't be corrupted in the event of common power loss or minor system crash (as I have never experienced it before in these kind of small files), so I was careless. Then came the unfortunate event wherein I have experienced a sudden power loss (I never got a chance to push the changes yet to git because I am waiting for the client's go signal) and my 24 KB javascript file got corrupted! My 5 hours of work was lost in that split second event! So then I have created this extension to prevent such thing from happening again in the future. Hope that it would be helpful to you all. Kind regards.
